# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Project** — a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb. This project simulates a real-world, scalable booking platform and includes both **frontend** and **backend** development tracks. Users can browse listings, book properties, make payments, and leave reviews, while hosts can manage their properties and bookings.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This full-stack project replicates Airbnb's core features, covering:

- A responsive and intuitive **frontend interface**
- A secure and robust **backend API**
- Scalable database design and data flow
- Deployment through modern DevOps practices

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Frontend Goals
- Build a clean, responsive UI using reusable components
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs
- Follow accessibility and mobile-first design principles

### Backend Goals
- Handle user authentication, bookings, payments, and reviews
- Document and secure RESTful & GraphQL APIs
- Deploy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| React.js | Build interactive UI components |
| HTML/CSS | Page structure and styling |
| JavaScript | Frontend logic |
| Tailwind/Figma | UI/UX design reference |
| Git & GitHub | Version control |

### Backend

| GitHub Actions | CI/CD pipeline automation |

## 🧠 UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Seamless booking user flow
- Consistent and accessible UI
- Fast and mobile-first design

### Key Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Property Listing | Filtered grid of available listings |
| Listing Detail | Property info, gallery, reviews, booking |
| Checkout | Payment, confirmation, success page |

### Color Palette
- #FF5A5F – Primary
- #008489 – Secondary
- #FFFFFF – Background
- #222222 – Primary Text
- #717171 – Secondary Text

### Typography
- Font: Circular
- Headings: Bold (700), 24–32px
- Body: Medium (500), 16px
- Secondary Text: Book (400), 14px

### Why Design Properties Matter
Proper mockup inspection ensures pixel-perfect implementation, clear communication between designers/developers, and a unified product feel.

## 👥 Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Project Manager | Manages planning and delivery timelines |
| Frontend Developer | Builds UI, integrates with APIs |
| Backend Developer | Develops endpoints and data logic |
| Database Admin | Manages schema, indexing, and optimization |
| QA Engineer | Tests functionality, reports bugs |
| DevOps Engineer | Manages Docker, CI/CD, deployments |
| Scrum Master | Coordinates agile sprints and blockers |
| Product Owner | Owns feature priorities and stakeholder needs |

## 🗃️ Database Design

### Entities and Fields

- Users: id, email, username, password, profile_image
- Properties: id, title, location, price, host_id
- Bookings: id, user_id, property_id, checkin, checkout
- Reviews: id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment
- Payments: id, booking_id, amount, payment_status

### Entity Relationships

- A user can list multiple properties
- A user can book multiple properties
- A property can have many bookings and reviews
- Each booking has one payment

## 🔄 Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| User Authentication | Register, log in, manage profiles securely |
| Property Listings | Add, edit, delete, and view properties |
| Search and Filters | Location, price range, rating filters |
| Booking System | Select dates, confirm availability, reserve |
| Payment Gateway | Process and confirm secure transactions |
| Reviews and Ratings | Users can leave reviews and see feedback |

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Measures
- Authentication: Token-based login (e.g., JWT)
- Authorization: Role-based route access
- Rate Limiting: Prevent endpoint abuse
- Input Validation: Block malicious inputs (SQL/XSS)
- HTTPS Only: Encrypt user data during transfer

### Why Security Matters
- Protects sensitive data like passwords and payments
- Prevents unauthorized property or booking manipulation
- Ensures trusted platform interaction

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What Is CI/CD?
CI/CD is the automation of building, testing, and deploying your code with every change—improving consistency and reducing manual errors.

### Tools Used:
- GitHub Actions – Auto-build/test on push or PR
- Docker – Containerized apps for any environment
- Heroku/Vercel – Deployment targets (or custom VPS)

### Pipeline Tasks:
- Run unit and integration tests
- Lint code for style consistency
- Deploy apps automatically upon merge
